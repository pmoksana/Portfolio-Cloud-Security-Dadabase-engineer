### About Me


     With 5 years of practical experience as a project manager and Scrum Master in global, multinational teams, I'm transitioning my career to a technical role. As a Data Engineer, I've built my knowledge in **SQL**, **Python**, **Machine Learning**, Linux, networking, **AWS services**, cloud infrastructure, and problem-solving. My passion lies in data science and analysis.

📌 What I actually can bring with my hands on past expirience:

### Soft skils:
* 🔹 Facilitate key Agile ceremonies and guide the team in applying Scrum values, ensuring we’re not just doing Agile, but being Agile
* 🔹 Co-create roadmaps and delivery plans based on team capacity, product goals, and metrics — balancing the short-term sprint rhythm with the big-picture strategy
* 🔹 Write epics, user stories, and requirements that help align dev work with business value
* 🔹 Support the Product Owner in backlog prioritization, refinement, and stakeholder alignment
* 🔹 Foster team connection and psychological safety through regular 1:1s, retrospectives, and open conversations — because delivery follows trust
* 🔹 Track risks, dependencies, and delivery health — and proactively course-correct when needed

📈 What’s worked well and shown good results:
* 🔸 Created onboarding flows for new engineers that reduced ramp-up time and improved retention
* 🔸 Introduced metrics-driven planning and delivery retrospectives that helped teams improve sprint-over-sprint
* 🔸 Established a shared understanding of the product vision and technical roadmap between devs, POs, and stakeholders
* 🔸 Facilitated dozens of retrospectives and feedback loops to help teams reflect and continuously evolve
