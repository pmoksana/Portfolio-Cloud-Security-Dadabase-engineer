ABOUT ME

I'm seeking a JUNIOR role or INTERNSHIP in cloud, networking, database, or security. While my background over the last 5+ years has been in Project Management and Scrum Mastering, suport teams in building Agile team mindset, tools administration (Jira, YouTrack, Confluence ...).
  Recently, I graduated from AWS training to build foundational knowledge in AWS services like EC2 and S3, and exploring network security principles. 
I'm serious about growing in cloud and tech as an engineer and eager to apply my unique blend of organizational skills and emerging technical expertise to a team where I can learn, contribute, and continue improving my everyday performance.
